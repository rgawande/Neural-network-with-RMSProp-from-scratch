        "More often than not, we will use a deep learning library (Tensorflow, Pytorch, or the wrapper known as Keras) to implement our models. However, the abstraction afforded by those libraries can make it hard to troubleshoot issues if we don't understand what is going on under the hood. In this assignment you will implement a fully-connected and a convolutional neural network from scratch. To simplify the implementation, we are asking you to implement static architectures, but you are free to support variable number of layers/neurons/activations/optimizers/etc. We recommend that you make use of private methods so you can easily troubleshoot small parts of your model as you develop them, instead of trying to figure out which parts are not working correctly after implementing everything. Also, keep in mind that there is code from your fully-connected neural network that can be re-used on the CNN. "
